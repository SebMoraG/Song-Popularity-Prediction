# Spotify Song Popularity Prediction

## Description 

This project aims to predict the popularity of songs on Spotify using different regression models. A Spotify dataset is used that contains musical characteristics of the songs, such as danceability, energy, key, loudness, mode, speechiness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo, and duration_ms.
## Requirements

- Python 3
- Python Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn

## Install

1. Clone the code for this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tu_usuario/tu_repositorio.git](https://github.com/SebMoraG/Song-Popularity-Prediction/`
2. Use the dateset in this repository to put in the code and see the results: `SpotifySongP.csv`
3. If you want to do the project from 0 use tgis dateset to clear it first: 'SpotifySongPolularityAPIExtract'


## Uses
1. Make sure you have the data in CSV format and save it in the `data` folder.
2. Run `main.py` file to perform song popularity analysis and prediction on Spotify.

## Results

Different regression models have been used, including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso and Random Forest, in order to find the model with the best performance. The results obtained are the following:

- Linear Regression:
  - Puntaje: -409.23225691079836
  - Mejores par치metros: {}

- Ridge:
  - Puntaje: -409.2145178262232
  - Mejores par치metros: {'alpha': 10.0}

- Lasso:
  - Puntaje: -410.9271983131269
  - Mejores par치metros: {'alpha': 0.1}

- Random Forest:
  - Puntaje: -383.54391206106504
  - Mejores par치metros: {'n_estimators': 200}
